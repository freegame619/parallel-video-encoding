Our project aims to implement a parallel video encoding system that try to decrease the overall encoding time taken and also to increase the speed of encoding by using a number of processors in parallel. The project is implemented using C programming language with help of ffmpeg developer API  and the encoding system is parallelized using the openMPI an open implementation of MPI standard.
